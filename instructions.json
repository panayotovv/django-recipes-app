    "text": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside. While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat, add the chopped onion, and cook for 3–4 minutes until softened. Stir in the garlic and cook briefly until fragrant, then add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned. Mix in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, oregano, and basil, adding a little beef stock or water if the sauce is too thick, and season with salt and black pepper. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 20–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until rich and well combined. Serve the Bolognese sauce over the cooked spaghetti and finish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs if desired."

Heat olive oil or butter in a large pan over medium heat, season the chicken with salt and pepper, and cook until golden and fully cooked, then remove from the pan and slice. In the same pan, melt butter and sauté the garlic briefly until fragrant, then add the heavy cream and let it gently simmer. Stir in grated Parmesan cheese and cook until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth. Add the cooked pasta and sliced chicken to the sauce, toss until evenly coated, and cook for 1–2 minutes more before serving hot."

Add 2 chopped tomatoes and cook until soft and the oil begins to separate. Mix in 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp cumin powder, ½ tsp turmeric, 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste), and salt. Add 1 kg chicken pieces and stir well to coat with the spices. Cook for 5–7 minutes until the chicken turns white. Pour in 1½ cups water, cover, and simmer on low heat for 20–25 minutes (less for boneless chicken), stirring occasionally. Finish with 1 tsp garam masala and garnish with fresh coriander.

    "text": "Cook 400g of spaghetti in salted boiling water until al dente. While the pasta cooks, cut 150 g of guanciale (or pancetta) into small pieces and cook in a pan over medium heat until crisp. In a bowl, whisk 3 large eggs with 100 g of finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Once the pasta is done, reserve about a cup of pasta water and drain the rest. Quickly toss the hot pasta with the guanciale off the heat, then add the egg and cheese mixture, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time if needed to loosen the sauce. Serve immediately, topped with extra cheese and black pepper."
